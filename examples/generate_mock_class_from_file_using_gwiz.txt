Running the following in the terminal from the root directory of the repository: "python3 gwiz.py examples/geeks.py"
Will write a file in the same directory called "MOCK_Geeks.cpp"
That file will contain the following:

class MOCK_Geeks {
public:
	MOCK_METHOD(void, printName, (), (const));
	MOCK_METHOD(int, doNothing, (int arg1, double arg2));
};
